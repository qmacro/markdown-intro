# What it is, and isn't

A lightweight markup language designed for the 80/20 rule

## It is

* Simple
* Readable in source form
* Writable with any editor
* Venerable ancestry
  * [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language) (-> SGML)
  * [Wiki Markup Language](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiMarkupLanguage)
* An Internet standard
  * [RFC7763](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7763)
  * [RFC7764](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7764)

## It is not

* WYSIWYG
* Proprietary

My take: the perfect balance for creators of technical and semi-technical content.

---

# What it is, and isn't (continued)

Simple markup syntax for:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Line breaks
* Emphasis
* Block quotes
* Lists
* Code
* Horizontal rules
* Links
* Images
* and more ...

---

# Why it's important to know about

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS -> Infrastructure-as-Code, Docs-as-Code
* Common ground for collaboration and contribution
* Ultimate micro-grained control vs tool-free & friction-free writing
* Source for many target formats (via e.g. `pandoc`)
* Allows you to _focus on the content_, not the presentation
